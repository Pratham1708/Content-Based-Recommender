## Overview

This project is a movie recommendation system that uses content-based filtering and actor similarity to suggest movies to users. The system is built using Python and Streamlit, and it uses the IMDB movie dataset to train the recommendation models.

## Features

*   Content-based filtering: recommends movies based on their genres, directors, and casts.
*   Actor similarity: recommends movies based on the actors who have worked together in other movies.
*   User-friendly interface: allows users to select a movie and get recommendations in real-time.
*   Loading spinner: adds a loading animation to the interface to improve user experience.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.12 or later
*   Streamlit 1.14 or later
*   Pandas 1.4 or later
*   NumPy 1.23 or later
*   Scikit-learn 1.1 or later

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git`
2.  Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`

## Usage

1.  Select a movie from the dropdown list.
2.  Click the "Get Recommendations" button to get a list of recommended movies.
3.  The recommended movies will be displayed in two columns: actor-based recommendations and content-based recommendations.
